# InDropX

## What is InDropX?
InDropX is a pipeline built to convert the inDrop data format from CB1 + CB2/UMI + RNA to CB/UMI + RNA so that it can be analyzed by different recent developed bioinformatics analysis tools such as [STARsolo](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/docs/STARsolo.md) or [kallistobus](https://www.kallistobus.tools).

It can demultiplex samples from the 4 ["Undetermined" fastq files from bcl2fastq](https://github.com/indrops/indrops) and correct cell barcodes using the whitelist provided by the original [InDrop pipeline](https://github.com/indrops/indrops).
